##  LocalGov Character Counter

This module is a wrapper to the [Textfield Counter](https://www.drupal.org/project/textfield_counter) module. It's
designed to make it easy to add character counting to title and summary fields for LocalGov Drupal content types.

It simplifies the process of adding character counting to title and summary by providing a single form that will
configure the Textfield Counter module for title and summary fields.

### Usage

To use this module, enable the localgov_char_count module and then visit the configuration page at
/admin/config/content/localgov-char-count.

On this page you can set maximum desired length of the title and summary fields, set the text that is displayed with the
character count and then choose the fields you wish to apply the character counting to.
